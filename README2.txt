Group members, x500:
Jonathan Castro, Castr385.
Abdirahman Hassan, Hassa878.

Contributions of each member:
Every time we were coding, we were together. We were sharing thoughts, logic, and errors that may come, and finally, we were writing the code interchangeably. 

How to compile and run our program: 
We used Intellij to code and run the programs.

Any assumptions:
None.

Additional features that we implemented:
None.

Any bugs or defects:
When user enters a move that is out of bounds, it prints "invalid move. Try again". You won't see it unless you
scroll up as the while loop prints the board after every move. Not necessarily a bug, but something to be aware of.

Any outside sources:
- We attended office hours and got help implementing some of our logic into code. More specifically, Pawn Promotion in the game board.

We certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
Abdirahman Hassan,
